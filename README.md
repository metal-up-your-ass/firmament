> **Work in progress.** Firmament is pre-1.0 and under active development. There are no built binaries or releases yet — building from source is currently the only way to run it. Expect breaking changes until v1.0.0 ships (see [Roadmap](#roadmap)).

<!-- ==BEGIN BODY== (plugin engineer: replace this block with What it is / Features / Signal flow / Roadmap) -->
## What it is

Firmament is a Mid/Side stereo widener and imager built on JUCE 8, aimed at giving lush symphonic-metal layers (strings, choirs, synth pads) a wider, more open stereo image without smearing the low end: it scales the Side channel of a Mid/Side encode to control apparent width, with an optional bass-mono crossover that keeps sub-bass content centered regardless of how wide the rest of the spectrum is pushed.

## Features (v0.1 scope)

- **Width** - 0-200% Mid/Side width scale; 0% collapses to mono, 100% is an unmodified pass-through of the input's stereo image, up to 200% doubles the Side channel for a maximally wide image
- **Bass Mono** - optional crossover (0-500 Hz, 0 = off) that forces the Side channel to mono below the chosen frequency, keeping sub-bass centered while Width still affects everything above it
- **Zero latency** - no oversampling or FIR stage anywhere in the chain; the bass-mono crossover is a zero-latency Linkwitz-Riley (TPT) structure, so `getLatencySamples()` is always 0
- **Mono-safe by construction** - because only the Side channel is ever touched, the mono downmix of the output is provably identical to the mono downmix of the input at any Width setting (see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md))
- **Output** - output trim, -24 dB to +24 dB
- Full state save/recall via `AudioProcessorValueTreeState`

## Signal flow

```
Input L/R --> Encode M/S --> Side x Width (0-200%) --> [optional] Bass Mono crossover
                                  |                            (forces Side -> 0 below cutoff)
                                Mid (untouched) ------------------------+
                                                                        v
                                                          Decode M/S --> Output trim --> Output L/R
```

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full breakdown, including the Mid/Side mono-compatibility invariant, the bass-mono crossover implementation, and mono-input-bus handling.

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Bootstrap - project skeleton, CI, docs | Done |
| M1 | DSP core - Width/Bass Mono/Output signal path, unit tests | Done |
| M2 | Custom GUI | Planned |
| M3 | Release engineering - signing, notarization, installers, v1.0.0 | Planned |

## Installation

No pre-built binaries are published yet (see the work-in-progress notice above). Once releases begin, installation will follow the standard plugin locations:

**macOS**

| Format | Path |
|---|---|
| AU (Component) | `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/` |
| VST3 | `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/` |

If Logic Pro doesn't pick up the plugin after installing, force a rescan by resetting the AU cache:

```sh
killall -9 AudioComponentRegistrar
auval -a
```

**Windows**

| Format | Path |
|---|---|
| VST3 | `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\` |

## Building from source

Requires JUCE 8.0.14, C++20, and CMake ≥ 3.24. See [`docs/building.md`](docs/building.md) for full prerequisites and step-by-step build/test commands for macOS and Windows.

```sh
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
